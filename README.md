# Memories

I designed this project to store precious memories of our lives.

This project stores all the important moments of a individuals:

By using goole login or creating an account you can create memories and save them in your own personal space.

other people can like the memories that has been shared in the one common space

you can like or delete your own created instance of memory.

Node.js with express used in back end to provide connect with MongoDb to fetch the data.

data is get stored in form of json files.

Then to show data from json files on front end I have used express to create a server which will be run after saving json files.

To run the server from background I have used child_process module of Node Js. It will run automatically.

all the data has been stored in MongoDB, i deployed the backend and front end using Zeet, Heroku, Netlify and as well as AWS cloud server.

To run this project intall all the dependencies available in package.json file :

To run the software: Use the following commands:-

npm install -----> this command will help to install project dependencies.

After all the modules get installed then run the index.js file using the following command:

split the terminal into two parts: 1 for client side and 1 for server side (unititled folder)  using Visual studio code.
on one side cd client and on other side cd server.
on both side run npm start ----> it will run the client and server side.


That's it You are ready to go.
